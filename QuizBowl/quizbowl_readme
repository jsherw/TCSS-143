This assignment was created in order to familiarize ourselves with the use of inheritance, lists, and dependencies.
The driver program "QuizBowl" was largely written by our TCSS 143 professor, Raghavi Sakpal, with students responsible for creating the fillQuestionBank method.
Otherwise, all other classes were left to the student to solve.

This program operates with a text file. (Provided by Professor Sakpal, transcribed below)
Students had to use a scanner to parse the information into three separate categories of questions, create classes and methods for those categories
unique requirements, create a general abstract class for shared characteristics, create an independent character class, and create a method to instantiate the
the question objects in the driver program.
