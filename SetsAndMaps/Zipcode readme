Both zipcode set and Zipcode map utilize a .csv file to provide data.
The csv file contained 11 columns and 500 rows with different types of data.

ZipcodeSet was meant to familiarize us with working with Sets in java. 
We created a program to read the file, store it as a Set, and perform operations on the data provided.
We created methods to find zipcodes within the data, and parse even and odd values from those zipcodes.
We also created a method to display maximum and minimum values from those sets.

ZipcodeMap asked us to use Maps to create searchable databases of the information in the .csv file.
Again, we read the file and stored the information in a Map. We then created methods that allowed
users to find information by searching for phone numbers contained in the list. We also created a 
method that searched the set for states with multiple residents and displayed the states along with all
person's associated with those states.
